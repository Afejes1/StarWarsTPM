# Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace PC Game Decomp and Custom Build

Welcome to the unofficial decompilation and custom build project for "Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace" PC game. This project aims to preserve, study, and enhance this classic game using modern technologies, including "The Force Engine" - a modern, open-source recreation of the legendary Jedi Engine from the 1990s.

## Project Plan

### Overview

Our mission is to create a buildable artifact from the existing code of "Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace." This ambitious endeavor involves utilizing "The Force Engine," which requires not only a deep understanding of the original Jedi Engine but also significant custom development, particularly for the game's AI engine.

### Goals

1. **Decompilation**: Decompile the original game binaries to understand the underlying code structure and mechanics.
2. **Analysis and Documentation**: Thoroughly document the game's codebase and mechanics, focusing on areas that will require adaptation to work with The Force Engine.
3. **Adaptation for The Force Engine**: Develop a strategy to integrate the decompiled code with The Force Engine. This includes mapping out the game's AI engine within the new environment.
4. **Custom AI Development**: Given the complexity of "The Phantom Menace's" AI, develop a custom AI engine compatible with The Force Engine, ensuring gameplay remains as true to the original as possible.
5. **Testing and Polishing**: Rigorous testing of the game on modern systems, followed by adjustments and optimizations to enhance performance and fidelity.

### Technologies

- **The Force Engine**: Our primary tool for bringing the decompiled code to life on modern hardware.
- **Modern Development Tools**: Utilize contemporary development tools for coding, documentation, and version control.
